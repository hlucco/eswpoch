# Eswpoch

Brings up a quick pick menu which allows swapping between units and shows the corresponding GMT time to the selecected timestamp. Created to reduce my daily total of visits to [https://epochconverter.com](https://epochconverter.com).

## Example

## Default Keybindings

`ctrl + alt + e` ---> `eswpoch.epochConvert`

## Overview

Once the cursor is over a valid timestamp value, on key press of the keybinding or activation of the command the menu will open and display the detected timestamp value in the user input bar. The options will be the supported converstions for that timestamp. Exit the menu and change nothing or cycle through the options and select one to cyle out. The old value will be replaced with the new value converted in line.
